## ✈️ Personal experiences

I have had the opportunity to travel to different places, which motivated me to learn English and sparked my interest in discovering new places and cultures. I also had the chance to live in Canada with a host family for a few weeks when I was 14, in a town called Yarmouth, a small town in the province of Nova Scotia. It was a great experience to make new friends and gain a deeper understanding of Canadian culture. However, it was also a challenge, as I had to adapt to speaking a language I wasn’t completely familiar with at the time. Overall, I learned to become more independent and realized that traveling gives you new perspectives on the world. Since then, I have tried to visit different places as much as I can.
