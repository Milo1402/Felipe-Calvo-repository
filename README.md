## ✈️ Personal experiences

I have had the opprotunity to travel around different places and this motivated me to learn English as well as being interested in knowing about differnt places and cultures. I was also able to live in Canada with a host family for a few weeks when I was 14 in a place called Yarmouth which is a small town in the state of Nova Scotia. It was a great experience for me to meet new friends and get to know better the canadian culture, however it was also a challenge as I had to adapt myself to speak in a language which I wasn't completely familiar with at the time. Overall I learnt to become more independent and to understand that travelling gives you new perspectives to see the world and since then I try to visit different places as much as I can.
